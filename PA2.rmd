# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 2

## Loading and preprocessing the data

The data for this assignment come in the form of a comma-separated-value file 
compressed via the bzip2 algorithm to reduce its size.  
It is sourced from the Coursera site.


```{r}
#Download file and decompress
url <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2"
file <- basename(url)
download.file(url, file, method="curl")
fcon <- bzfile(file, open="r")
#Read CSV file
stormData <-read.csv(fcon, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
close(fcon)
#Keep relevant columns
stormData <- stormData[, c("BGN_DATE", "STATE", "EVTYPE", "END_DATE", "FATALITIES", "INJURIES", "PROPDMG", "PROPDMGEXP", "CROPDMG", "CROPDMGEXP")]
#Remove non US-states such as PR and ST in the data
stormData <- stormData[(stormData$STATE %in% c(state.abb, "DC")), ]
```

##Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?
